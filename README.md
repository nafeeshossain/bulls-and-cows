I made this project in my **2nd Semester**, but I had not uploaded it to GitHub.

Welcome to **Bulls and Cows**, a fun and challenging number guessing game built in the C programming language!  
This is a terminal-based game where you try to guess a secret 4-digit number with **all unique digits**.  
For every guess, you'll get hints in the form of:

- 🐂 **Bulls** – correct digit in the **correct position**
